						<h1>PRIMARY SCOOL</h1>
						<h5>SK <span>LUKUT</span></h5>
						<p>I only went to one elementary school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Lukut, for grades one through six. Primary school encompassed much more than simply academics. It was about learning priceless lessons that would mould me into the person I am today, making lifelong friends, and discovering abilities I never realised I possessed.</p>

						<h1>SECONDARY SCHOOL</h1>
						<h5>SMK <span>YTR</span></h5>
						<p>My secondary education was at Yam Tuan Radin Secondary School, where I attended Forms 1 through 5 till I received 6As on my SPM exam. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, of course. There were days when the strain seemed to be sucking the joy out of my life, times of heartache and disappointment, and late-night study sessions driven by desperation and instant noodles. But despite everything, I gained knowledge about the value of resiliency, the strength of tenacity, and the steadfast support of a group of people who were more like family to me than fellow students.</p>

						<h1>UNIVERSITY</h1>
						<h5>UiTM <span>CAW. REMBAU</span></h5>
						<p>And now I continue my studies at UiTM Caw.Rembau. Recently I am in the final semester, which is semester 5. University is a time of immense personal and academic growth. It's a time when I step outside my comfort zones, challenge ourselves intellectually, and forge friendships that will last a lifetime.
						I remember my own university days fondly. The late-night study sessions fueled by coffee and camaraderie. The exhilarating feeling of acing a tough exam. The joy of discovering new passions and interests. But university is not just about academics. It's also about the people we meet along the way. The quirky classmates who become our study buddies. The inspiring professors who ignite our curiosity. The mentors who guide us through life's challenges.</p>
